# ZSH Installer Script
Just a little script I made to install and initialize ZSH with the look and feel of Bash, along with the addition of some features from Fish.
> ⚠️ The installer will reset any previous ZSH installation. Only use this if it is your first time installing ZSH.

## Installing 
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/specarino/zsh/main/zsh-installer.sh
    chmod +x zsh-installer.sh
    ./zsh-installer.sh
